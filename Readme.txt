This little bash script is here to regroup all the tools
you need to stay anonymous on the internet

Currently, it use tor (torghost) and macchanger

How to use:
sudo chmod +x Anonymator.bash
sudo bash Anonymator.bash

This scipt is under active development, they are a few bugs while using
macchanger because of connexion lost but I will fix that soon
