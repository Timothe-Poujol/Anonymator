This little bash script is here to here to regroup all the tools
you need to stay anonymous on the internet

Currently, it use tor (torghost) and macchanger

How to use:
sudo chmod +x Anonymator.bash
sudo bash Anonymator.bash

This scipt is under active development, they are a few bugs while using
macchanger because of connexion lost but I will fix that soon
